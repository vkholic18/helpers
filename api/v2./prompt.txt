left side require fields for registering host

right side data we receive in csv from Inventory Reconciliation cmd/api

 

requirement - all fields from left side should be present in right side csv file, in order to do automation to periodically register the missing VM daily

 
To summarize, for the automation to synchronize VMs in CMDB, we need following data:

Need data for VMs such as Host Name, DataCenter etc which is needed for registering the assets in CMDB
CIDR Block ownership should be with the user who is registering these devices (Rohit Sasikumar do we have nay service ID which can be used here)
